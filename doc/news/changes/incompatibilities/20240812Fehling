Removed: The CMake option `DEAL_II_COMPILE_EXAMPLES` has been removed.
As a consequence, examples will no longer be compiled if
`DEAL_II_COMPONENT_EXAMPLES` is set to true.
<br>
You can use the testsuite to compile all examples at once. First, set up
the `setup_tests_examples` target, i.e., with `make setup_tests_examples`.
Then compile and run the examples with `ctest -R examples`.
