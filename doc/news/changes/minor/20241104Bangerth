New: The cmake configuration system now allows enabling
interprocedural and link-time optimization by the compiler. These
kinds of optimization often result in substantially faster executables
because they allow the compiler to see a bigger part of the whole
program when optimizing.

To enable interprocedural and link-time optimization, pass the
`-DDEAL_II_USE_LTO=ON` flag to cmake when configuring the library.
