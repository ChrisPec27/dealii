Deprecated: The Utilities::MPI::ConsensusAlgorithms::Payload base
class has been deprecated. It used to serve as an interface class for
the algorithms in namespace Utilities::MPI::ConsensusAlgorithms, but
we have since come up with ways of formulating these algorithms in
terms of function objects that are more flexible than the base
class/virtual function interface now deprecated.
