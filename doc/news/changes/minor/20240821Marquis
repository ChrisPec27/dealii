Fixed: Previously, FiniteElement::has_generalized_support_points() and 
FiniteElement::has_face_support_points() returned false for the FE_Nothing element. Now, FE_Nothing::has_generalized_support_points() and 
FE_Nothing::has_face_support_points() correctly return true, as the empty 
arrays returned by FE_Nothing::get_generalized_support_points() and FE_Nothing::get_unit_face_support_points() accurately describe the support 
points of the element(i.e., they don't have any, as there are no
degrees of freedom).
