Fixed: The FiniteElement::has_support_points() function is poorly
named because it does not return *whether* an element has support
points, but whether it *implements* the
FiniteElement::get_unit_support_points() function correctly. Because
of this misunderstanding, it returned `false` for the FE_Nothing
element. This is now fixed: FE_Nothing::has_support_points() now
returns `true`, because the empty array returned by
FE_Nothing::get_unit_support_points() correctly describes the support
points the element has (namely: it does not have any, as there are no
degrees of freedom).
